# NoNarrator

Don't like the narrator? Just get rid of it! NoNarrator completely disables the narrator at its lowest level. This also
prevents annoying errors in your log when the required libraries can't be loaded. This mod is super simple and tiny, and
shouldn't conflict with any other mods. It should work on any version of Minecraft and any version of Fabric - if you
find a version that it doesn't work on, just open an issue!
